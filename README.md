Key Features :

1.üîê Secure Login System
Employee Authentication: Every user must log in using their unique Employee ID and password. This prevents unauthorized access to sensitive chemical data.

Role-Based Access: There are two user roles‚ÄîAdmin and Employee. Admins have full control, including the ability to add or update chemicals, while Employees have restricted access, typically limited to viewing and searching inventory data.

Session Management: The system ensures that only active, authenticated sessions can interact with the application, further enhancing security.

2.üìä Interactive Dashboard

Central Hub: After logging in, users are taken to the dashboard, which serves as the main control center for all inventory activities.

Summarized Data: The dashboard displays a comprehensive table of all chemicals, including key details such as opening balance, quantities received and consumed, closing stock, expiry dates, and measurement units.

Visual Indicators: Color-coded tags and icons highlight low stock levels, expired chemicals, or other critical conditions, enabling users to take prompt action.

Live Updates: All data on the dashboard is updated in real time, ensuring users always see the most current information.

3.üè≠ Unit-wise Inventory Tracking

Departmental Organization: Each chemical is associated with a specific unit within the refinery (e.g., AVU, FCC, DCU, PRU). This allows for clear separation and management of chemicals by department.

Responsibility Breakdown: Supervisors and staff can focus on the chemicals relevant to their unit, reducing confusion and improving accountability.

Easy Filtering: Users can filter inventory data by unit, making it simple to locate and manage chemicals for a particular section of the refinery.

4.üì§ Export to PDF and Excel

PDF Export: Users can generate a print-friendly, time-stamped PDF report of the current inventory view. This is useful for compliance, audits, or sharing with management.

Excel Export: Inventory data can be exported to Excel spreadsheets, enabling advanced analysis, long-term storage, or integration with other business systems.

Traceability: All exported files include the current date and time, ensuring traceability and supporting regulatory requirements.

5.üõ† Add & Manage Chemicals

Admin Controls: Admin users can add new chemicals to the system or update the details of existing stocks.

Tracked Fields: Each chemical entry includes the chemical name, associated unit, opening balance, quantities received and consumed, closing balance (calculated automatically), measurement unit (e.g., kg, L), expiry date, and a timestamp of the last update.

Audit Trail: Every transaction or update is logged with a timestamp, ensuring full traceability and accountability for all inventory changes.

6.üîé Search & Filter

Keyword Search: Users can quickly find chemicals by typing part of the chemical name, unit, or measurement type.

Drop-Down Filters: The interface includes drop-down menus for filtering by unit or chemical name, making it easy to narrow down results.

Instant Results: The inventory table updates in real time as users apply search terms or filters, ensuring a smooth and efficient user experience.

7.üîÑ Auto Session Check

Session Validation: The system regularly checks the validity of user sessions. If a session becomes inactive or unauthorized, the user is logged out automatically.

Enhanced Security: This feature helps prevent unauthorized access and ensures that only legitimate users can interact with the application.

Use Case in IOCL (Paradip Refinery) :

In a complex facility like IOCL Paradip, hundreds of chemicals are consumed daily for processes such as distillation, catalytic cracking, coking, and recovery. Managing these chemicals manually can lead to several problems:

Stock Mismatches: Manual errors can cause discrepancies between recorded and actual stock, leading to shortages or overstocking.

Improper Usage: Without real-time tracking, chemicals may be overused or underused, affecting process efficiency and safety.

Expired Chemicals: Lack of expiry tracking can result in the use of expired chemicals, posing safety and compliance risks.

Regulatory Compliance: Manual records are difficult to audit and may not meet stringent safety and environmental regulations.

The Chemical Inventory Management Dashboard addresses these challenges by automating inventory tracking, providing real-time visibility, and ensuring that every transaction is logged and auditable.
